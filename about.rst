title: About

My name is Ramiro. I am currently a Computer Science master's student at
Stanford.

The purpose of this blog is to share interesting concepts and ideas that
I have come across while exploring different areas of computer science.

My main interests include programming language theory, systems programming,
and functional programming, so most of my posts will involve languages like
Haskell and Rust.
